Simple HUD Remover & Simple Holograms are one of my first releases.

They are both meant to be quite simple and easy to use.

The Simple HUD Remover script allows you to disable parts of the HUD. You could disable the radar, vehicle information or even the weapon wheel!

The Simple Holograms script allows you to place floating 3d text/holograms around the world. They can have custom colors, fonts & styling.
